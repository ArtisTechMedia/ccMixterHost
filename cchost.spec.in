# around. The fix for this is to strip off the "SVN" from the version number
# and use it in the "release" field instead.

%description
The goal of this project is to spread media content that is licensed under 
Creative Commons throughout the web in much the same way that weblogs spread CC
licensed text. The more installations of ccHost and its variations, the more 
content there will be available for enjoyment and artistic re-use in a sane 
and legal setting.
