Installation notes for ccHost 5.1
====================================

Please check the project website/wiki to see if there are updates to any of 
these steps: http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost#Install


New Install (Simple or Hosted Environment)
------------------------------------------

If you are using a shared server or other hosted site (like Dreamhost, etc.) 
then your hosting service probably provided you with a web interface for 
creating a database, doing file uploads and setting permissions for files and 
directories. 

    1. Create a new database for ccHost using whatever means your hosting
       environment makes available to you. During the creation take note
       of the following information:

     - database name
	 - database user
	 - database user's password
	 - database's server location (typically, but not always, 'localhost')

    2. Unzip the ccHost ZIP archive on your local system and copy the files to 
       your server retaining the the directory structure so that the file
       'index.php' is in your root directory

    3. Browse to http://where_you_installed/ccadmin and follow all the 
       instructions from then on. 


New Install (Advanced)
----------------------

If you have basic knowledge of using FTP and you are comfortable
at a Unix/Linux command line you can use these steps to install: 

    1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP archive on your local system 
       and copy the files (retaining the directory structure) to your web 
       server.

       For example:

       cp -a cchost-4.0.0 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost
       chgrp -R apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost
       chmod g+w /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/

   2. Install getID3.  Unpack the package, and then copy the getid3 directory 
      to the location it will be accessed.  For example:

      tar xzf getid3.tar.gz
      cp -a getid3/getid3 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/

   3. Create a database instance and users to access it.  For example:

      mysql -p -u root

      mysql> CREATE DATABASE cchost;
      mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE ON cchost.* 
      ->     TO 'cchost'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

      Make sure to change 'password' (and maybe cchost) to something
      unique to your site.

   4. Create directory /var/log/cchost or other location to store log files.  
      Must be writable by apache.  For example:

      mkdir /var/log/cchost
      chown apache:apache /var/log/cchost

   5. Browse to http://where_you_installed_cchost/ccadmin 

   6. Follow the instructions from there on...

Upgrading from 5.0 or higher to 5.1
---------------------------------------

   1. Unzip ccHost ZIP archive to a local machine
   2. Delete the ccadmin directory
   3. Copy all 5.0.1 file over your existing site
   4. While logged in as admin, browse to http://<your_installation_root>?update=1

Upgrading from 3.1 or higher to 5.0
-----------------------------------

  -1. Make a backup of your database.

   1. Unzip cchost ZIP archive to a local machine.

   2. Copy ALL the 5.1 files over your existing site

   3. Browse to http://where_you_installed_cchost

   4. Importing phpTal Templates

      None of your version 4 skins, pages, etc. work anymore as is. You can 
      try to import your old phpTAL XML templates using:

          bin/cc-host-import-v4-template.php 

      Many imported templates (like your home page) might "just work" 
      but many will need tweaking, assuming you are familiar with PHP.

Upgrading from 3.0 or lower to 5.0 or higher
--------------------------------------------

Upgrading from 3.0 or lower installation has not been tested. 
It should theoritically work the same as upgrading from 
a ccHost 4.x installation.
