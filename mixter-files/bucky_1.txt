For over 8 years <a href="http://www.buckyjonson.com">Bucky Jonson</a> has been the band behind the 
Grammy winning Black Eyed Peas but now, through <a href="http://bbemusic.com/">BBE Music</a> has stepped out
in front with "<a href="http://www.bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBECD083">The Band Behind the Front...</a>.
Now they have decided to join the the <a href="http://www.one-self.net/">One Self</a> 
collective  collaboration and put the tracks to that album into the Creative Commons Sample Pool under a 
Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0</a> license. 
(BBE Music is not officially affiliated with Creative Commons or ccMixter,
we just think they define cool and want to use their samples.)
