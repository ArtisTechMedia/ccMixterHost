<h2 >About DJ Vadim</h2>
<div  style="margin-right: 210px">
<p >
  Hardest working man in show business? Trouper? Tireless? However you want to put it, be sure of one thing, 
  when DJ Vadim first heard the phrase "Don’t sleep” he obviously took it literally.

Over the last decade few people can have put so much time and energy into the culture they love. Founder of Jazz Fudge in early 1995, A&R, producer, DJ, promoter, record collector, radio presenter, occasional painter, writer, and in-house producer/dj and cohort of Latin Grammy nominees, Spanish hip hop super group 7 Notas 7 Colorez, Vadim has certainly been keeping himself busy. And that’s before we even mention his DJing itself which has seen him perform in virtually every country in Europe(east and west), all over North America, Australia, New Zealand. Japan, Israel, Turkey, South America and South East Asia in just the last year. He has also performed with the likes of DJ Krush, Company Flow, The Roots, Pharcyde, Public Enemy, Beat Junkies, Dilated Peoples, Kraftwerk, supported Super Furry Animals, Morcheeba and Paul Weller as well as at events like Glastonbury and the Moscow Street Ball festival (to over 60,000 people!). To describe the man as an internationalist almost seems to sell him short.

<p >In 1992, the Russian ex-pat bought a sampler and the rest is the stuff of 
cultural legend. (Read more at DJ Vadim's <a  href="http://www.myspace.com/djayvadim">MySpace</a> page.)</p>

"We're putting out the vocals and instrument parts from these 2 tunes and seeing what you all can do. Bring in your own elements and make of them what you wish, work with the flow and rhythmical patter of 'Kill Kill Kill' feat. Big Red and Kathrin DeBoer or the atmospheric 'Talk To Me' featuring Sena. It is essential in this game not to sit back and wait for people to come to your music. As independents we need to work hard and get our music out there and heard. So get producing and then get spreading it. We look forward to hearing the results."
