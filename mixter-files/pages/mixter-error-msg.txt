    <h3>wups, ccMixter is experiencing technical difficulties...</h3>
    <p>If you were in the middle of an upload or posting a message it probably worked OK
    but you should click <a href="/">here</a> to get back to the site's home page or 
    use your browser's BACK button to return to the site and make sure.</p>
    <p>The admins have been notified of the problem and will look into it very shortly.</p>
