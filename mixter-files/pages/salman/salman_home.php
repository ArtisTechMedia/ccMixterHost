I think what Magnatune and ccMixter represents is the future of music promotion, distribution and marketing. I've already been 
through the guerilla school of music in my life so taking on the future is something I've always been waiting for!

<h2 >About Salman</h2>
<p >
Salman Ahmad is a doctor by training and a rock musician by
profession. Salman went to school in his birth place of
Lahore, Pakistan and then moved with his family to New York where he
went to Tappan Zee high school in Tappan, NY.
</p><p >
After graduating from high school in the U.S. he got his medical
degree from Pakistan's King Edward Medical college in Lahore. While in
school he was also a member of Pakistan's first pop band, Vital
Signs, whose debut album sold a million copies. The album included the
mega-hit anthem "<i >Dil, Dil Pakistan</i>". That success
made Vital Signs into overnight pop stars. This is when Salman
decided that he was going to give up his stethoscope and pick up his
guitar. He left Vital Signs in 1990 and founded South Asia's
biggest rock band, Junoon.
</p><p >
Junoon has sold over <b >25 million albums</b> (!) world wide and has the
distinction of being the first ever rock band to be invited to perform
at the United Nations general assembly by U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan.
</p><p >
Salman has also been appointed as U.N. goodwill ambassador for
HIV/AIDS. He has personalized the "I care, do you?"  U.N. poster
campaign in Pakistan by paraphrasing a popular quranic verse "saving
one life (from AIDS) is like saving the whole of humanity." He's been
interviewed or quoted in major newspaper and magazine publications
like the New York Times, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Newsweek
and Time and has also appeared as a commentator on major television
networks like CNN, BBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, MTV and VH-1 and other global
media networks. Recently he has appeared in two documentary films: <i >It's My
Country Too</i> on Muslim-Americans and <i >Rockstar and the Mullahs</i> which
has won a SAJA Award. Both films have been broadcast worldwide on PBS
and the BBC.
