Vieux Farka Touré is the son of the late international superstar and
two-time Grammy Award-winner Ali Farka Touré. An historic passing of
the torch from father to son is represented by Vieux’s debut. He has
crafted a globalminded style all his own with original compositions
displaying flourishes of rock and reggae amidst Saharan Blues and
traditional Malian melodies. Vieux Farka Touré is ushering in the next
generation of Mali blues on his self-titled debut album which features
Ali himself on two remarkable pieces. These tracks are the only existing
recordings of father and son playing together, and are amongst the final
recorded material of Ali before his death. The album also features two
magnificent guest performances by the Grammy Award-winning kora master
Toumani Diabaté.

“Vieux Remixed” takes these beautiful acoustic recording and readies
them for the dance floor. Working with the gorgeous strings, able voice
and stellar percussion of the original, DJs such as Cheb I Sabbah, Karsh
Kale, Nickodemus and Yossi Fine have created rich renditions ready for
bass-heavy speakers. Ranging from hypnotic soundscapes to dance floor
crushers, “Vieux Remixed” matches the diverse style of the young
virtuoso himself. Rounding out the incredible cast of remixers, the
album also features Chris Annibell, Eccodek, DJ Center, DK & Cenzo and
Fabian Alsultany.

Ten percent of proceeds from both albums go towards Bée Sago to fight
against malaria in Niafunke, the home region of the Farka Touré family
in Northern Mali. Bée Sago, a local award-winning organization,
affiliated with UNICEF, specializes in the manufacture and distribution
of insecticide-treated mosquito nets to children and pregnant mothers in
Mali.

<strong >Jesse Brenner, Modiba Productions</strong>: "One of Modiba's central goals as an organization is collaboration, the 
expansion of boundaries to bring in new ideas and approaches  through 
working together in an open and dynamic way.  The Creative  Commons 
project is a perfect example of this, and we look forward to  bringing 
more talented and inspired minds to further explore the  sounds of Vieux Farka 
Touré."
</p>
<p >
<strong >Derek Beres, Global Beat Fusion</strong>:
"Taking Vieux's incredible acoustic material and adding a digital edge
is what the future of global music is about. We've been remixing
cultures as long as cultures have formed, explored and, inevitably, met
one another. Our modern technological capabilities are giving us the
opportunity to get to know one another socially, spiritually and
sonically. This project will be yet another meeting ground, this time
the gorgeous blues of Mali and the rest of the creative world."
