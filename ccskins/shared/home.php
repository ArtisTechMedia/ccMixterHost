<p>
This is the old (deprecated) home page template used by
installations previous to ccHost 5.1.
</p>
<p>
If you are seeing this, you probably never edited it from
the previous installation.
</p>
<?
  $content_url = ccl('admin','content');
  $settings_url = ccl('admin','settings');
?>
<p>
Feel free to head on over the <a href="<?=$content_url?>">Content Manager</a> to
start editing the home page content, then the <a href="<?=$settings_url?>">admin setting page</a> to have it
point to your "real" home page.
