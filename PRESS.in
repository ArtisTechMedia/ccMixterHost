Creative Commons Sponsored Software ccHost Releases Version 5.1

San Francisco, USA

Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible
copyright licenses for authors and artists along with the Creative
Commons Developer Community released the ccHost 5.1 today. ccHost is an
Open Source web-based media sharing software. This
release builds upon ccHost's novel support of collaboration, sharing,
and storage of multi-media using the different Creative Commons licenses
and metadata.

These features most notably show up and are tested in Creative Commons'
project, ccMixter (www.ccmixter.org), a popular on-line social network
service that supports legal music sharing and remixing. ccHost is the
Open Source Software engine powering ccmixter.org and which anyone may
download, install, and use to freely build media sharing communities.

This 5.1 represents over a year of stabalization of the major 5.0 upgrade
from from early 2008. There are also many new features, including support
for OpenID, CC0 (CC Zero) waivers, extensive license configuration and
dozens of other imporvements and features. 

The ccHost development community encourages new developers to
contribute to the project. The future of ccHost is bright with upcoming
development focusing on user and admin requests for features like further
generalization of media support, better tools to support social networking
features, and further language support.

About ccHost

ccHost is a content management system, winner of the Linux Journal
LinuxWorldExpo Product Excellence Award for Best Open Source Solution. 
The goal of this project is to spread media content that is licensed
under Creative Commons throughout the web in much the same way that
weblogs spread CC licensed text. ccHost is web-based infrastructure that
may be used to host and allow for commenting, remixing, and distribution
globally. The more installations of ccHost and its variations, the more
content there will be available for enjoyment and artistic re-use in a
sane and legal setting. ccHost is what is used for the infamous Creative
Commons ccMixter project, which supports legal media sharing and remixing.


About Creative Commons

Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that promotes the creative
re-use of intellectual and artistic works - whether owned or in the
public domain. Creative Commons licenses provide a flexible range of
protections and freedoms that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept
of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved"
approach. Creative Commons is sustained by the generous support of various
foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,
the Omidyar Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, as well as members of the public.
